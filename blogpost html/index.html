        <h1> Information about CAA/CAB:</h1>
            <strong><p class=date>Date:  DEC 11th 2019</p></strong>
        <p class="main-text">  Now that protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019 <strong>(CAA) </strong>has spread far and wide and prohibitory orders     (Section 144) and internet shutdowns have become the order of the day, a lot of confusion has spread over the meaning and implication of this law and its links with Population Register (PR), National Population Register (NPR), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Register for Indian Citizens (NRIC).

Here is a reality check on the implications and links among these through what official gazette notifications, laws and rules provide for. It seeks to clear the fog of confusion before arriving at any conclusion.<br>

            <strong>Myth 1: Nation-wide NRC not announced. Reality Check</strong>: It has been notified in the official gazette

The process of preparing a nation-wide NRC has been kick-started with a gazette notification of July 31, 2019. <br>The notification said:<br><br>

            <strong>"In pursuance of sub-rule (4) of rule 3 of the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, the Central Government hereby decides to prepare and update the Population Register (PR) and the field work for house to house enumeration throughout the country except Assam for collection of information relating to all persons who are usually residing within the jurisdiction of local registrar shall be undertaken between the 1st day of April 2020 to 30th September, 2020."</strong>strong></p>
        
        <h2>CITIZENSHIP (AMENDMENT) ACT/BILL:</h2>        
        <p class = "main-text">The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 was passed by the Parliament of India on 11 December 2019. It amended the Citizenship Act of 1955 by providing a path to Indian citizenship for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities fleeing persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.[2] Muslims were not given such eligibility.[3][4] The act was the first time religion had been used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law.[5]<br>
<br>
            The Hindu nationalist <strong>Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)</strong>, which leads the Indian government, had promised in previous election manifestos to offer Indian citizenship to persecuted religious minorities from neighboring countries.[6][7] Under the 2019 amendment, migrants who had entered India by 31 December 2014, and had suffered "religious persecution or fear of religious persecution" in their country of origin were made eligible for citizenship.[2] The amendment also relaxed the residence requirement for naturalization of these migrants from eleven years to five.[8] Immediate beneficiaries of the Bill, according to the Intelligence Bureau of India, will be 31,313 refugees: 25,447 Hindus, 5,807 Sikhs, 55 Christians, 2 Buddhists and 2 Parsis.[9]<p>
